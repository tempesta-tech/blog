-------------------------

- static inline functions could be conditionned by #ifdef (eg: dup/unique
  processing, locking, ...)

- EB function names :

  - eb_test{,_ge,_le} : test if the requested key exists
  - eb_find{,_ge,_le} : find the requested key    (= current lookup)
  - eb_pick{,_ge,_le} : find and delete the requested key

- EB trees can be made more space-efficient :

  - optimised for indexing (insert,lookup) : removing node_p/leaf_p
    saves two pointers at the expense of a delete() in O(log(N))

  - compact key storage : removing bit/depth makes all operations
    happen on the XOR of the keys. This is efficient when keys are the
    branches addresses, but for all other situations it means one
    indirect access to retrieve the key. Ordered dups are not possible
    anymore, at best the node's address can be used as a sorting key
    between them. This is acceptable for indexing since it will also
    match the arrival order. It's also acceptable for memory area
    lookups where there cannot be any dups.

- compact+indexing are useful for memory area indexing. Can be open-coded in
  a memory manager to have another operation : eb_fuse{_lt,_gt} : make the
  lookup function aware of the contents of the node. Typically the node is
  indexed by its own position and contains a size. The eb_fuse_lt() function
  will look up the largest key strictly smaller than the value passed, and
  will verify that this key + its size exactly match the value passed. If so,
  then the two are merged into a larger entry (sizes add up) and the resulting
  key is returned. eb_fuse_gt() does the opposite, it looks up the key larger
  than value+its size, and if found, then the new key is inserted with the
  total size and the previous one is removed. There's the case where inserting
  one key results in removing 2 (the previous and the next one), maybe we should
  consider 3 fuse operations instead :

      - fuse_before
      - fuse_after
      - fuse_middle

  It seems this should be open-coded though.

- Deleting a node in optimised-for-indexing mode is difficult :

   - ... but is needed (purge, timeout, etc...)
   - the key needs to be looked up first in the tree
   - then in case the tree supports dups, the proper node needs to be found
     based on the dup-indexing method (eg: use the pointer as a second key).


==> EB trees can be tailored for various usages :

    - very fast and fair insertion/removal (eg: timers, priority queues, ...),
      or complex operations such as prefix lookups
      => full EB tree

    - no/unfair dups processing, slower indirect lookup but more compact
      storage without no bit/depth. Useful for fast memory area indexing
      (pointers are keys).
      => compact EB tree, saves 32-bit per node.

    - indexing words (eg: log processing), slow removal :
      => indexing EB tree (without upper pointers).

    - indexing words/pointers with very low overhead, slow removal, no/unfair
      dups (flat log indexing, low-overhead memory management)
      => CB tree (compact+indexing)
